ASP.NET Core OData v8 builds the endpoints ahead (during startup) which makes every endpoints declared explicitly and be there for whole application life.

Customers benefit from this mechanisam for simple request, however sometime when the endpoint number is huge, it could be a problem. 

There are many ways to reduce the endpoint number. This sample illustrates a way to use 'dynamic controller' to avoid build the OData endpoint ahead.

## Endpoints overview

Here's all endpoints created ahead. You can see there's no OData endpoint created.

## Query entityset

I created an action as below to handle "entityset query"
```
[HttpGet]
[EnableQuery]
[ODataRoute("{entityset}")]
public IActionResult Get(string entitySet)
```

So, you can send the follow (4) requests to get "Customers, Orders, People":

## Query single entity

I created an action as below to handle "single entity query"

```
[HttpGet]
[EnableQuery]
[ODataRoute("{entityset}({key})")]
public IActionResult Get(string entitySet, int key)
```

So, you can send the follow (4) requests to get entity:

## Query property

I created two actions as below to handle "property query"

### 1. using static string
```C#
[HttpGet]
[ODataRoute("v1", "customers/{key}/Address")]
public IActionResult GetAddress(int key)
```

### 2. using template string
```C#
[HttpGet]
[ODataRoute("v2", "{entityset}({key})/{property}")]
public IActionResult Get(string entitySet, int key, string property)
```

You can see, if you try to query "v1/people(2)/emails", it's not found.

## Query options

I enabled the OData query ($select only for your reference, you can enable more) for 'v1' as:


```C#
app.MapODataRoute("v1", q => q.EnableSelect = true);
app.MapODataRoute("v2");
```
Here's the requests:
